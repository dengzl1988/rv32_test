# Simulation Assets

Use this directory to organize simulation run scripts, configuration files, and regression infrastructure.

## Contents

- `waves/` – Waveform configuration files for viewers like GTKWave or DVE.
- `runs/` – Example run directories with Makefiles or launch scripts.
- `logs/` – Collected log files from regressions (can be excluded from version control).

## Usage

1. Document simulator command-line options and environment variables here.
2. Provide step-by-step instructions for running smoke tests and full regressions.
3. Capture tips for debugging failures, including waveform capture settings and log filtering commands.

Keep this README synchronized with actual flows to reduce onboarding time for new contributors.
