# Architecture Overview

This document captures the high-level architecture of the RV32 digital chip design. Use it to describe the major functional blocks, their responsibilities, and their interfaces.

## Design Goals

- Provide a configurable 32-bit RISC-V pipeline suitable for embedded applications.
- Balance performance, area, and power targets defined by the product requirements.
- Maintain modularity to allow reuse of common subsystems.

## Top-Level Block Diagram

_Add a diagram or textual description of the top-level modules and their connections._

## Core Components

1. **Processor Core** – Outline pipeline stages, hazard management, and CSR support.
2. **Instruction Fetch** – Describe memory hierarchy integration and prefetch strategies.
3. **Execution Units** – Capture ALU, multiplier/divider, and other custom units.
4. **Memory System** – Explain data cache, load/store unit, and memory interfaces.
5. **Peripherals** – Enumerate integrated peripherals and communication buses.

## Interface Specifications

Document signal lists, protocols, and timing requirements for each module interface. Include references to industry standards when applicable.

## Future Work

- Track planned extensions such as custom instructions, security features, or debug modules.
- Note architectural assumptions that must be validated through verification or implementation feedback.
