# Third-Party IP Directory

Use this directory to track external IP cores integrated into the RV32 design.

## Usage

- Document licensing terms and version information for each imported IP block.
- Maintain integration notes, including wrappers or adapters required for compatibility.
- Store any configuration scripts or parameter files associated with the IP.

If redistribution is restricted, include placeholders or instructions for obtaining the IP separately.
