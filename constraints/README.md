# Constraints Directory

Store timing, floorplanning, and synthesis constraint files in this directory. Organize files by tool or flow (e.g., `sdc/`, `xdc/`, `floorplan/`).

## Recommendations

- Keep constraint files under version control to ensure reproducible implementation results.
- Document the target process technology and library versions referenced by each constraint set.
- Update this README with instructions when multiple configurations or corners are supported.
