# Scripts Directory

Place reusable automation scripts for simulation, linting, synthesis, and verification flows here.

## Best Practices

- Provide a short usage description at the top of each script.
- Keep scripts parameterized and avoid hard-coded absolute paths.
- Capture dependencies such as Python packages in `requirements.txt` or equivalent files.

Document complex flows directly in this README or link to detailed guides under `docs/`.
